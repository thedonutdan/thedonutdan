                    <h1>Genetic Algorithms</h1>
                    <p>A while back, a friend of mine, Kevin Caravaggio, started 
                        posting on his blog about a project aimed at benchmarking
                         various approaches to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem.
                          So far the project had featured Test-Driven-Development with
                           Maven and a near-neighbor greedy algorithm. His first blog post
                            on the subject is linked here: <a href="https://seedshare.io/blog/tsp1/">seedshare.io/blog</a>. Looking to add 
                            some variety to the approaches for solving this problem, he asked
                             me to write a genetic routing algorithm.</p>
                    <p>We won’t get too deep into the project structure, test-driven development,
                         or the greedy algorithm for TSP since that is already well documented on 
                         Kevin’s blog. However I thought it would be fun to go over my contribution
                          to the project with a focus on the algorithm and benchmarking. So a great
                           place to start is the problem statement Kevin started with:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Worldwide e-commerce retailer, Congo.com, has begun trials of its UAV delivery
                         service, which uses drones to ship smaller products to customers in the area 
                         surrounding a distribution center. As an engineer at Congo, your task is to 
                         develop a drone routing program. Your program should accept the location of 
                         the distribution center and a list of the customer locations as inputs and 
                         return a list of customers in the order they should be visited.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This percectly fits the bill for the classic TSP problem: given a fully 
                        connected weighted graph, find the shortest route that visits each node 
                        exactly once and forms a single cycle. Nearest-neighbor takes a simple and 
                        obvious approach, start with the closest node, then next closest, and on and 
                        on until all nodes are visited. Genetic routing algorithms are part of a larger
                         family of algorithms which are particularly useful for solving some interesting
                          NP-Hard problems.</p>
                    <h2>Genetic Algorithms</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>So what exactly is a genetic algorithm? Simply put a genetic algorithm will generate
                         a set of solutions for the problem at hand, then use the “best” solutions to generate
                          new ones. This process will repeat until some threshold is met or a certain number
                           of generations have been worked through. To do this we must define a set of 
                           valid(though not necessarilly optimal) solutions, a fitness function, thresholds 
                           for survivorship, and of course a limit on the number of generations. What does 
                           that look like for our problem? Well we can lay it out quickly below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Valid solutions: Any path that visits each node exactly once and contains exactly one cycle</li>
                        <li>Fitness function: Distance of path according to edge weights</li>
                        <li>Threshholds for survivorship: We’ll start by allowing the 10% most fit paths and 10% chosen
                             through tournament to survive and “reproduce” for the next generation.</li>
                        <li>Limit on number of generations: Not strictly defined in our case, my current implementation 
                            allows for configuration through the API. Note that this is the main decider in balancing performance vs accuracy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With these defined we can now build a concrete algorithm:</p>
                    <p>Given a distribution center, a list of customers, a defined popsize, and a limit on generations:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Generate popsize number of routes by randomly permutating customer list (in our case we are 
                            always working in permutations to ensure solutions are valid according to TSP)</li>
                        <li>Preserve top 10% of routes according to the fitness function (route length) and 10% of 
                            the remaining routes according to tournament selection, cull the rest of the routes</li>
                        <li>Generate 35% of children utilizing order crossover (splice route segments from one parent to another then fill in the blanks in-order)</li>
                        <li>Generate 35% of children through swap mutation (swap order of two destinations in survivor route)</li>
                        <li>Introduce 10% of popsize as completely random permutation (this helps maintain genetic diversity)</li>
                        <li>Repeat generation limit times and return fittest route</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The brute-force approach to TSP is O(n!) time complexity, our approach tries to undercut this using a bit of randomness 
                        and a heuristic assumption: good solutions are likely made up of good smaller parts, so we can propogate these good 
                        subparts through generations using order crossover and swap mutations. This covers everything you need to know to 
                        understand later code, but of course the genetic algorithm rabbit hole goes deeper. Another classic problem is the 
                        Knapsack Problem, but NASA even used a Genetic Algorithm to design an Evolved Antenna in an interesting case of this 
                        algorithm in the wild. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">Genetic Algorithms (Wikipedia)</a>]</p>
                    
                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Looking at how to implement this we already have a good project structure to start with. We have an abstract drone 
                        router class that will take care of the basics, an injectible distance function for abstraction, and all the relevant
                         classes to model the problem (i.e. ServiceDestination.java holds all pertinent information about destinations). 
                         So we can go ahead and put together a class that extends AbstractDroneRouter.java with a proper constructor:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-java">
public class GeneticDroneRouter extends AbstractDroneRouter {
  private int epochs;
  private int populationSize;
  private Random random = new Random();

  public GeneticDroneRouter(TravelMetric distanceFn, int epochs, int populationSize) {
    super(distanceFn);
    this.epochs = epochs;
    this.populationSize = populationSize;
  }
  (...)
}

                    </code></pre>
                    <p>And then we can go ahead and implement the required method route(), starting with initial random population generation:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-java">
// Start with completely random population
    List<List<ServiceDestination>> population = new ArrayList<>();

    for (int i = 0; i < populationSize; i++) {
        List<ServiceDestination> randRoute = new ArrayList<>(serviceDestinations);
        Collections.shuffle(randRoute);
        population.add(randRoute);
    }

                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        As for our main loop, each step we will cull the population, crossover survivors, mutate survivors, and introduce randomness:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-java">
    // Cull, crossover, mutate, introduce randomness
    for (int i = 0; i < epochs; i++) {
      List<List<ServiceDestination>> culledPopulation = cull(population, distributionCenter);
      population = new ArrayList<>(culledPopulation);
      // Crossover
      while (population.size() < (int) Math.round(populationSize * 0.55)) {
        population.add(
            OX(
                culledPopulation.get(random.nextInt(culledPopulation.size())),
                culledPopulation.get(random.nextInt(culledPopulation.size()))));
      }
      // Mutate
      while (population.size() < (int) Math.round(populationSize * 0.9)) {
        int randIdx = random.nextInt(culledPopulation.size());
        population.add(swapMutate(culledPopulation.get(randIdx)));
      }
      // Maintain diversity
      while (population.size() < populationSize) {
        List<ServiceDestination> randRoute = new ArrayList<>(serviceDestinations);
        Collections.shuffle(randRoute);
        population.add(randRoute);
      }
    }
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This gets the general gist, but of course the interesting 
                        stuff happens in our helper functions, mainly cull() and OX(). 
                        Starting with cull() we will simply sort, save the top 10%, then 
                        call our tournamentElimination() function to select an additional 10%:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-java">
  private List<List<ServiceDestination>> cull(
      List<List<ServiceDestination>> population, ServiceDestination origin) {
    List<List<ServiceDestination>> newPopulation = new ArrayList<>();
    int eliteCount = populationSize / 10; // Keep elite 10 percent
    int tournamentCount = populationSize / 10; // Keep 10% selected via tournament

    List<List<ServiceDestination>> sorted = new ArrayList<>(population);
    sorted.sort(Comparator.comparingDouble(route -> routeLength(route, origin)));

    List<List<ServiceDestination>> elites = sorted.subList(0, eliteCount);
    for (int i = 0; i < eliteCount; i++) {
      newPopulation.add(new ArrayList<>(elites.get(i)));
    }

    newPopulation.addAll(
        tournamentElimination(sorted.subList(eliteCount, sorted.size()), tournamentCount, origin));

    return newPopulation;
  }
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        routeLength() is just a helper function that accounts for the length of the full
                         path including the origin. So this culls the less fit routes from our population 
                         using elitism (keeping the fittest) but the next 10% is chosen through tournament, 
                         which is an interesting concept. While tournaments sound like they should pick only 
                         the best just like elitism, we actually will be running tournaments on subsets of 
                         the remaining population which gives slightly less optimal routes a chance to survive
                          and helps us maintain genetic diversity. Our code is shown below:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-java">
  private List<List<ServiceDestination>> tournamentElimination(
      List<List<ServiceDestination>> population, int survivorCount, ServiceDestination origin) {
    List<List<ServiceDestination>> survivors = new ArrayList<>();

    for (int i = 0; i < survivorCount; i++) {
      List<List<ServiceDestination>> tournament = new ArrayList<>();

      for (int j = 0; j < population.size() / 5; j++) {
        List<ServiceDestination> candidate = population.get(random.nextInt(population.size()));
        tournament.add(candidate);
      }

      tournament.sort(Comparator.comparingDouble(route -> routeLength(route, origin)));

      survivors.add(tournament.get(0));
    }

    return survivors;
  }
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This runs tournaments with only a fifth of the population each time.
                         The rationale behind this is that if a route is good enough to beat 
                         out a fifth of the population, it probably has some useful genes (subroutes)
                          that could be benefitial to preserve in the population. Which leads us 
                          on to our final bit of interesting code, the OX() function. This is one
                           of a handleful of useful crossover methods that apply to our problem 
                           and it functions by choosing a random-length subroute in parent1 and 
                           creating a child with that subroute in the same location and the rest
                            filled in-order from parent2. An example is shown below for clarity 
                            with the selected gene underlined:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
p1:    A B C <span style="text-decoration: underline;">D E F</span> G  
p2:    G A F C D B E  
child: G A C <span style="text-decoration: underline;">D E F</span> B 
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        If we just make a few list copies this is pretty elementary to implement in code:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-java">
  private List<ServiceDestination> OX(
      List<ServiceDestination> parent1, List<ServiceDestination> parent2) {
    // Randomly select a gene from parent1 starting in the first half and ending in the last half
    int size = parent1.size();
    int start = random.nextInt(size / 2);
    int end = start + random.nextInt(size - start);
    List<ServiceDestination> child = new ArrayList<>(Collections.nCopies(size, null));

    // Preserve allele position from gene in child
    for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
      child.set(i, parent1.get(i));
    }

    // Fill in remaining slots with parent2 alleles (starting after gene and wrapping back around)
    int currentIdx = (end + 1) % size;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      ServiceDestination candidate = parent2.get((end + 1 + i) % size);
      if (!child.contains(candidate)) {
        child.set(currentIdx, candidate);
        currentIdx = (currentIdx + 1) % size;
      }
    }

    return child;
  }
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>Success! Well, at least in terms of correctness. Optimality is of course the NP-hard part of the problem here which is what I will be exploring in my next
                         post where we’ll build a tester program that will use Java Microbenchmark Harness and known optimal solutions from a site like TSPLIB to compare both 
                         runtime performance and optimality performance.</p>
