# Hi there, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I am a Marine Veteran and currently attending UC San Diego pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science which I will complete in the Spring of 2025. I began programming as a hobby around 2008 making computer games. In 2019 I began attending Palomar Community College with intent to transfer to UC San Diego as a Computer Science Major. I enjoy working on team-based projects and in my free time explore new languages, tools, and frameworks.
