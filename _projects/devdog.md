This project was completed over six weeks for CSE 110 - Software Engineering at University of California, San Diego. I was team lead on a 9-person team and lead the design, development and deployment of the journaling webapp. We utilized the Agile process and Github Projects to track and plan our work. I also oversaw the implementation of the CI/CD pipeline and performed code reviews.

Deployed App: [DevDog](https://cse110-sp24-group4.github.io/cse110-sp24-group4/source/)

This project allowed me to utilize the leadership skills I developed in the Marine Corps and as a Sous Chef as well as exposing me to many software engineering concepts/challenges and new technologies in the industry.
