This is my contribution to [kevvurs/combinatorics](https://github.com/kevvurs/combinatorics) where I wrote a genetic routing algorithm to solve TSP. It was a fun exploration into a new kind of algorithm and also provided plenty of chances to get comfortable finding unique ways to solve hard optimization problems. I also added [JMH](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh) to the project to provide performance metrics as well as an assessment class to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms.
