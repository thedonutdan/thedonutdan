                <p>I embarked on this project after completing my Intro to Java course at 
                    Palomar College circa June 2020. We had covered the Java basics and done 
                    some static image rendering with Java AWT, but I wanted to dive a little 
                    deeper and I was missing the days in middle school when I was making a 
                    lot of games. Over the course of two days I wrote a scratch clone of Asteroids. 
                    The project features all the OOP goodies, polymorphism, inheritance, abstract 
                    classes, the works. It also presented some fun challenges as my first introduction
                     to vectors and vector calculus (Wikipedia was a savior for this) as well as 
                     concurrency issues. So, to the docs I went. Oracle’s official docs had a treasure 
                     trove of information on how to properly create a runnable to handle the timer as 
                     well as general game control for checking collisions, updating positions, 
                     removing gamepieces, etc. I also meticulously commented java-doc compatible 
                     comments throughout the code.

                    This project was a ton of fun. It brought to light new software engineering issues that I had not ever thought of as well as reminding me of how exciting programming can be.
