                <h1>Vehicle Maintenance React App</h1>
                <p>I built this project essentially as the magnum opus to complete my college education.
                     During my time at UC San Diego I took classes focused on various parts of web development
                      from database design, backend design, frontends, security, and networking. Now that I knew
                       all the individual parts I felt it was time to combine them into a solo-built full stack 
                       webapp that showcases my ability to put all the requisite parts together. This also served
                        as a fun little playground to familiarize myself with web technologies such as Spring Boot, 
                        React, Vite, and Typescript. The app is quite simple at this point, a user can create an 
                        account and then enter vehicle information that they want to track maintenance for as well 
                        as maintenance that has been performed on the vehicles. The app is at an MVP stage, but I 
                        have been careful to design it as modular as possible which will allow me to continue working
                         on it to add additional features as I have time to work on it. In the future I plan to 
                         implement optimistic updates on the frontend to allow for a more responsive frontend 
                         experience, an AI-powered microservice to allow users to ask for tips on how to maintain
                          their vehicles, more detailed maintenance records with the option to upload related documents,
                           and a searching and filtering feature to allow users to better locate the vehicles and maintenance records they are looking for.
