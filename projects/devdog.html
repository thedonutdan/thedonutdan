                <p>This project was completed over six weeks for CSE 110 - Software Engineering at University of California,
                     San Diego. I was team lead on a 9-person team and lead the design, development and deployment of the 
                     journaling webapp. We utilized the Agile process and Github Projects to track and plan our work. I 
                     also oversaw the implementation of the CI/CD pipeline and performed code reviews.

                    This project allowed me to utilize the leadership skills I developed in the Marine Corps and as a Sous Chef as well as exposing me to many software engineering concepts/challenges and new technologies in the industry.
